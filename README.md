# Food Interpreter
The purpose of the Food Interpreter is to allow users to easily add Foods that they've eaten into a text file, and use the interpreter to create a graph with details of what they've eaten throughout their recorded lifetime. This is to help users learn what habits they have with their food intake, the nutrients and quantities they ingest, find a pattern of potential IBS triggering foods, and much more. It is currently in progress with the lexer and tests, and test pipeline completed.
